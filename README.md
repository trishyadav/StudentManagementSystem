Controller: In Spring Boot, a controller is a class responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning appropriate responses. Handles users request and passes it to the underlying components

Entity: An entity represents a persistent data structure, typically mapped to a database table. In Spring Boot, an entity is usually a Java class that is annotated with @Entity. 

Repository: A repository, often referred to as a data access object (DAO), provides an interface to interact with the database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the entities.

Service: A service encapsulates the business logic and provides a higher-level abstraction for handling complex operations.
